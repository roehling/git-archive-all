Beware that the script requires GNU variants of getopt and tar.

On macOS you can use Homebrew to install those:

    brew install gnu-getopt
    brew install gnu-tar

Remember to follow Homebrew instructions to setup PATH, so that the above variants of the tools are found **before** the stock ones.
